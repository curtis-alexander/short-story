Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling. It should have two methods: `roll` which takes in the number of pins knocked down, and `score` which is called at the end and returns the total game score.


write method "roll" to count number of pins knocked down
  make an array of numbers 0-10
    make sure the array prints out in the method
  be able to grab a sample number from the array
    check to see if it works and the number is random
      once the sample is taken, set it to a variable
       that variable needs to be subtracted from 10 (giving the number of remaining pins)
      this number then needs to be the number of indexs in a new array + 1 taking into account the 0
      set each index to a number starting at zero and going up till the index number is reached
      then take a sample from the new array
      add the second pulled number to the original score variable 
  set that sample to be the score for the total number of pins knocked down so far

      if the number is 10 different rules will apply for the next frame
  have a variable to reset the "score" to be the previous score + the new "roll"
  write a loop to let the "bowler" have 10 rolls
    if 

write method "score" to give total number of pins for the game
  make sure the method runs 
  have the method print the total score variable
